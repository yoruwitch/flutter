# Flutter - Studies 

* Welcome to my personal Github Studies for Flutter. Here you're going to find everything I did while following [Daniel Ciolfi's course](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-completo-flutter-app-android-ios/).
  
* This page is going to be updated with the projects ongoing. For more details, please refer to the porper paste of each project.

### Documentation:
* Besides the course, I'm using [Flutter's Official Documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/tutorials) to help me out.
* But if you're an experienced dev, please, feel free to contact me to give me some tips.

### Assets:
